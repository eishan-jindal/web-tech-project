Hey Guys! Use it as you like! BTW Dont forget to include this readme file :)

You need to create a mongoDB account first via terminal to login into the account.
db.member.insert(
{
    "name" : "adam",
    "lname" : "smith",
    "reg_no" : "15bce2022",
    "password" : "abc123",
    "branch" : "cse",
    "year" : "2015",
    "sex" : "male",
    "email" : "adam.smith2015@vit.ac.in",
    "mobile" : "1234567890",
    "dob" : "1996-11-21",
    "address" : "l-369",
    "department" : "HR",
    "project" : "Ullas"
})

I am uploading screnshots too.
And don't forget to install dependencies using npm.
